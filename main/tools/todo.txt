
  hull tex is still hard-coded

SPACE LABYRINTHS:
  labyrinths should be outside systems
  labyrinths should have exterior space with deco & unique enemies

ASTEROID CLUSTERS:
  should be instead of planets
  should have unique enemies
  asteroids should take dmg, fall apart and burn in atmosphere

FEATURES:
  random encounters
  add mount type to ship cfg
  loot should be pulled more gently
  smooth camera rotation + sometimes camera does 360 when leaving a planet
  stars
  brakes
  hummers as stations
  moar items
  moar ships
  moar planet types
  hardness
  slower planet rotation
  enemy stations, woohoo!

SOUND:
  sounds for other damage types
  todo list

ARCHITECTURE:
  path loading for missing hulls
  rotate all ship images (and properly create on-ground enemies)
  get rid of generated white texture
  far ship positions should be calculated on demand?
  arcSin -> arcToAngle(hordeLen, r) -> 180*hordeLen/(pi*r)
  arcSin -> angularWidthOfSphere(r, dist) -> arcSin(r/dist)
  arcSin -> angularWidthOfTangentSpan(spanLen, dist) -> arcTan(spanLen/dist)

BUGS:
  greater ground battle dist
  dynamic AI shoot angle
  planet tiles and stations movement method creates glitches
  bullets fly thru ships sometimes -- blame shields... needs better understanding of Box2D categories
  bullets are too narrow on phone -- use realLineWidth() as a minimum width
  strange shard speeds
  multiple enemies spawn in one point on planet
  ships somehow get inside planet.

UI:
  new UI
  "new" mark in the inventory

???
  remember consumed angles on planet


===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use starChunkMan?

BUGS

ARCHITECTURE
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0. But this would require reusing solTex used by emitters

FEATURES
  planet labyrinths?
  respawn enemies?
  explorers should avoid tough enemies
  ship traces reusable?
  save
  better ship smoke
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  try using shaders

PERF
  use objFloatMap in soundMan
  use circles instead of polys
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  make ChunkMan distances constants
  less or equal in ChunkMan
