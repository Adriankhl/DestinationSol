

IN PROGRESS:
  asteroids should take dmg, fall apart and burn in atmosphere


FEATURES:
  heat from stars + new damage type
  loot should be pulled more gently
  hardness
  brakes
  path loading for missing hulls
  get rid of generated white texture
  far ship positions should be calculated on demand?


TRIVIAL:
  shipConfig should have:
    money,
    hasRepairer,
    mountFixeds
    + add this all to planet enemy configs + space enemy configs
  asteroid clusters should have bigger asteroids
  smooth camera rotation + sometimes camera does 360 when leaving a planet
  slower planet rotation
  arcSin -> arcToAngle(hordeLen, r) -> 180*hordeLen/(pi*r)
  arcSin -> angularWidthOfSphere(r, dist) -> arcSin(r/dist)
  arcSin -> angularWidthOfTangentSpan(spanLen, dist) -> arcTan(spanLen/dist)
  rotate all ship images (and properly create on-ground enemies)


CONTENT:
  asteroid belts should have unique enemies
  moar items
  moar ships
  moar planet types
  enemy stations with guardians


SOUND:
  sounds for other damage types
  sound for null armor
  todo list


???
  remember consumed angles on planet


BUGS:
  isPlaceEmpty should consider mazes and special encounters?
  greater ground battle dist
  dynamic AI shoot angle
  planet tiles and stations movement method creates glitches
  bullets fly thru ships sometimes -- blame shields... needs better understanding of Box2D categories
  bullets are too narrow on phone -- use realLineWidth() as a minimum width
  strange shard speeds
  multiple enemies spawn in one point on planet
  ships somehow get inside planet.


UI:
  new UI
  "new" mark in the inventory

===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use starChunkMan?

BUGS

ARCHITECTURE
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0. But this would require reusing solTex used by emitters

FEATURES
  damaged ship hulls in place of exploded ships
  random encounters
  planet labyrinths?
  respawn enemies?
  explorers should avoid tough enemies
  ship traces reusable?
  save
  better ship smoke
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  try using shaders

PERF
  use objFloatMap in soundMan
  use circles instead of polys
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  make ChunkMan distances constants
  less or equal in ChunkMan
