  arcSin -> angularWidthOfSphere(r, dist) -> arcSin(r/dist)
  arcSin -> angularWidthOfTangentSpan(spanLen, dist) -> arcTan(spanLen/dist)
  get rid of generated white texture

FEATURES:
  brakes
  config file for trade ships & space stations & explorers
  loot should be pulled more gently
  path loading for missing hulls
  far ship positions should be calculated on demand?
  smooth camera rotation + sometimes camera does 360 when leaving a planet
  sky should change color in the sunset


TRIVIAL:
  properly create on-ground enemies -- if hull is not station, angle should differ
  Guardian DestProvider should be able to guard not only a ship, but also Vector2 targetPos
  shipConfig should have:
    money,
    hasRepairer,
    mountFixeds
    + add this all to planet enemy configs + space enemy configs
  add colors.json where an artist could define:
    dust color
    in-game sun color
    ???
  burning particle effect
  dust particle effect on asteroid split
  starports should be on different distances from planet center, since now they overlap
  black filler inside planets, also lower planet tiles should have darker tint
  there should be only one asteroid belt per system, in the center
  slower planet rotation


SOUND:
  sound for armors being hit with each damage type
  sound for null armor being hit with each damage type
  sound for collisions for ground
  sound for collisions for metal
  sound for ground being hit with each damage type
  todo list


CONTENT:
  asteroid belts should have unique enemies
  moar items
  moar ships
  moar planet types
  enemy stations with guardians


BUGS:
  isPlaceEmpty should consider mazes and special encounters?
  dynamic AI shoot angle
  planet tiles and stations movement method creates glitches
  bullets fly thru ships sometimes -- blame shields... needs better understanding of Box2D categories
  bullets are too narrow on phone -- use realLineWidth() as a minimum width
  strange shard speeds
  multiple enemies spawn in one point on planet --   remember consumed angles on planet
  ships somehow get inside planet -- blame the current movement method?


PERF:
  use circles instead of polys


UI:
  new UI
  "new" mark in the inventory

===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use starChunkMan?

BUGS

ARCHITECTURE
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0. But this would require reusing solTex used by emitters

FEATURES
  damaged ship hulls in place of exploded ships
  random encounters
  planet labyrinths?
  respawn enemies?
  explorers should avoid tough enemies
  ship traces reusable?
  save
  better ship smoke
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  try using shaders

PERF
  use objFloatMap in soundMan
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  make ChunkMan distances constants
  less or equal in ChunkMan
