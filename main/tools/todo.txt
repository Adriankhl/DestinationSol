DATA:
  balancing


CODING:
  hull descriptions
  ai should equip collected stuff
  credits
  grav should affect cannon projectiles
  minerTurret doesn't shoot


DRAWING:
  skull areas
  pirate space station hull shades
  guns
  projectiles
  ability effects + teleport blip
  electricity particle
  trees on frozen
  draw ui icons
  new title


TEST ANDROID RUN:
  pack textures, launch on android to ensure that everything works


PERF:
  texture packing optimizations:
    split big stations from ships
    divide particles folder to misc & ship abilities
    unite asteroids, farJunks, junks and shards in 1 folder
    move skies to misc
  map and ui should carefully draw. implement some class that helps to store values
  cache frequently used values:
    body masses
    cam.realLineWidth?
    some other calculated stuff
    object's distance to np, to cam?
  skip emitter ops if they're not working
  far ship positions should be calculated on demand?


ADD ALL SOUND PLACEHOLDERS


ANDROID RUN 2:
  stress test on every object preloaded


PERF OPTIONAL:
  optimize getVec? but don't remove, cuz freeing helps fix bugs
  compare dstSq instead of dst -- maybe not needed, iterating through object is only quadratic


IN THE END:
  final balancing
  check paths, g e positions
  hardness? armor bonus + brakes
  lights
  tutorial should consider new control type, also mobile, also highlight buttons
  demo
  check licenses:
    in-game:
      font
      sounds
      libgdx
      box 2d
      java distro
    in internet:
      sf
      markets vs open source

===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use another chunk layer for stars

ARCHITECTURE
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0. But this would require reusing solTex used by emitters
  sound volumes should be kept in one map file?

FEATURES
  "dangerous enemy near" warning
  brakes
  inventory category filtering
  boss-like stations on planets and space
  decorative houses on planets
  out of ability charges sound
  out of ammo sound
  environment sounds
  shield orbiting blips: use some static pulsating texture that will fade away with shield life?
  dmg effects should reflect dmg amt
  varying maze tile sizes
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better sky colors?
  starports should be on differernt distances from planet center, since now they overlap
  voice warnings
  ship traces reusable?
  update pitch to all played sounds if game time is changed?
  damaged ship hulls in place of exploded ships
  random encounters
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  planet labyrinths?
  save?
  respawn enemies
  explorers should avoid tough enemies
  try using shaders

PERF
  use objFloatMap in soundMan
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  improve teleport -- transfer body instantly via setTransform()
  get rid of Pilot.getMapHint
