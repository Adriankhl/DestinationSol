

PERF:
  build everything as far + SG.isPlaceEmpty should iterate over far objs
  get rid of getVec, use static vectors, 3 should be enough
  far ship positions should be calculated on demand?
  test on every object preloaded


SOUND:
  environment!
  force field work
  star journey:
   start
   finish
   working
  no ammo
  projectile work
  items:
    pick up
    drop
  ability:
    activation
    rejection
    out of charges


PARTICLES:
  star ports: replace static energy lines with some nice effects.. Probably 4 similar from each side & something in the center
  star journey: replace static image with some nice effect
  abilities


enemies should use abilities


DISCUSS:
  landscape types?
  shield orbiting blips: use some static pulsating texture that will fade away with shield life?
  item pickup blip
  force beacon: replace static texture with moving ones


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ AFTER ALL CONTENT IS IN THE GAME

use circles instead of polys where possible

TRADING:
  jsons will have tradeItems, that would resolve in the list of items
  ships will start with half of that items
  ships will slowly generate new items from that list
  ships will not generate if they already possess item (or 5 if clips)
  ships to buy:
    jsons will have tradeShips
    the rest is the same as for items
  ships to hire


BALANCE:
  energy weaker vs armor, bullet weaker against shield
  neutral ships?
  hardness
  unfixed mount
  move mazes closer?
  brakes?
  respawn enemies?
  save?
  explorers should avoid tough enemies?


UI:
  new UI
  "new" mark in the inventory
  control types
  split item icons from ui icons
  ui dra man
  item color categories
  warn about dangerous enemy near


EH:
  bullets are too narrow on phone -- use realLineWidth() as a minimum width
  update pitch to all played sounds if game time is changed? or just properly set initial pitch
  ships sometimes get inside tiles
  starports should be on differernt distances from planet center, since now they overlap

===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use another chunk layer for stars

ARCHITECTURE
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0. But this would require reusing solTex used by emitters

FEATURES
  damaged ship hulls in place of exploded ships
  random encounters
  planet labyrinths?
  ship traces reusable?
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  try using shaders
  better sky colors?

PERF
  use objFloatMap in soundMan
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  improve teleport -- transfer body instantly via setTransform()
