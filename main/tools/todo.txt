

IN PROGRESS:
  stars
  heat from stars on all



FEATURES:
  hardness
  brakes
  loot should be pulled more gently
  path loading for missing hulls
  get rid of generated white texture
  far ship positions should be calculated on demand?
  arcSin -> arcToAngle(hordeLen, r) -> 180*hordeLen/(pi*r)
  arcSin -> angularWidthOfSphere(r, dist) -> arcSin(r/dist)
  arcSin -> angularWidthOfTangentSpan(spanLen, dist) -> arcTan(spanLen/dist)
  asteroid clusters should have bigger asteroids
  smooth camera rotation + sometimes camera does 360 when leaving a planet


TRIVIAL:
  rotate all ship images (and properly create on-ground enemies)
  shipConfig should have:
    money,
    hasRepairer,
    mountFixeds
    + add this all to planet enemy configs + space enemy configs
  slower planet rotation
  burning particle effect
  dust particle effect on ateroid split
  starports should be on different distances from planet center, since now they overlap


SOUND:
  sound for armors being hit with each damage type
  sound for null armor being hit with each damage type
  sound for collisions for ground
  sound for collisions for metal
  sound for ground being hit with each damage type
  todo list


CONTENT:
  asteroid belts should have unique enemies
  moar items
  moar ships
  moar planet types
  enemy stations with guardians


BUGS:
  isPlaceEmpty should consider mazes and special encounters?
  dynamic AI shoot angle
  planet tiles and stations movement method creates glitches
  bullets fly thru ships sometimes -- blame shields... needs better understanding of Box2D categories
  bullets are too narrow on phone -- use realLineWidth() as a minimum width
  strange shard speeds
  multiple enemies spawn in one point on planet --   remember consumed angles on planet
  ships somehow get inside planet -- blame the current movement method?


UI:
  new UI
  "new" mark in the inventory

===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use starChunkMan?

BUGS

ARCHITECTURE
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0. But this would require reusing solTex used by emitters

FEATURES
  damaged ship hulls in place of exploded ships
  random encounters
  planet labyrinths?
  respawn enemies?
  explorers should avoid tough enemies
  ship traces reusable?
  save
  better ship smoke
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  try using shaders

PERF
  use objFloatMap in soundMan
  use circles instead of polys
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  make ChunkMan distances constants
  less or equal in ChunkMan
