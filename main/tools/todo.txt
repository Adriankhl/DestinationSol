


FEATURES:
  hardness


CONTENT:
  moar items
  ship unique abilities:
    EMP with the power param -- first eat shields, then disable controls for the rest of the charge power
    teleporter -- teleports you around enemy, but not near planets or stations (otherwise bugs possible)
    ??
  add pointer to asteroid textures in SystemConfig json?


SOUND:
  sound for armors being hit with each damage type
  sound for null armor being hit with each damage type
  sound for collisions for ground
  sound for collisions for metal
  sound for ground being hit with each damage type
  todo list


TRADING:
  jsons will have tradeItems, that would resolve in the list of items
  ships will start with half of that items
  ships will slowly generate new items from that list
  ships will not generate if they already possess item (or 5 if clips)
  trading ships:
    jsons will have tradeShips
    the rest is the same as for items


TRIVIAL:
  add colors.json where an artist could define:
    dust color
    in-game sun color
    ???
  burning particle effect
  dust particle effect on asteroid split
  black filler inside planets, also lower planet tiles should have darker tint


UI:
  new UI
  "new" mark in the inventory


+++++++++++FROM THIS POINT, NO NEW CONTENT IS ADDED TO THE GAME


FEATURES:
  brakes?
  dynamic AI shoot angle
  loot should be pulled more gently: just apply force
  smooth camera rotation + sometimes camera does 360 when leaving a planet
  get rid of generated white texture -- use the one of texMan


TRIVIAL:
  Guardian DestProvider should be able to guard not only a ship, but also Vector2 targetPos
  starports should be on differernt distances from planet center, since now they overlap
  there should be only one asteroid belt per system, near the center
  mainStation should be in the center of the system
  slower planet rotation


BUGS:
  isPlaceEmpty should consider mazes and special encounters? or should it consider every daym thing?
  planet tiles and stations movement method creates glitches
  bullets fly thru ships sometimes -- blame shields... needs better understanding of Box2D categories
  bullets are too narrow on phone -- use realLineWidth() as a minimum width
  strange shard speeds
  multiple enemies spawn in one point on planet --   remember consumed angles on planet
  ships somehow get inside planet -- blame the current movement method?


PERF:
  use circles instead of polys
  far ship positions should be calculated on demand?


===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use starChunkMan?

BUGS

ARCHITECTURE
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0. But this would require reusing solTex used by emitters

FEATURES
  damaged ship hulls in place of exploded ships
  random encounters
  planet labyrinths?
  respawn enemies?
  explorers should avoid tough enemies
  ship traces reusable?
  save
  better ship smoke
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  try using shaders

PERF
  use objFloatMap in soundMan
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  make ChunkMan distances constants
  less or equal in ChunkMan
