
bullets fly thru

bullets too narrow on phone
get rid of generated white texture
strange shard speeds

far ship delayed pos calc?
explorers should avoid tough enemies
remember consumed angles on planet

===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use starChunkMan?

BUGS
  check if there are objects inside planet.

ARCHITECTURE
  arcSin -> arcToAngle(hordeLen, r) -> 180*hordeLen/(pi*r)
  arcSin -> angularWidthOfSphere(r, dist) -> arcSin(r/dist)
  arcSin -> angularWidthOfTangentSpan(spanLen, dist) -> arcTan(spanLen/dist)

FEATURES
  asteroids should fall apart + in atm
  "new" mark in the inventory
  persistent ship amt ctrlr
  ship traces reusable?
  save
  better ship smoke
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  try using shaders

PERF
  use circles instead of polys
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  make ChunkMan distances constants
  less or equal in ChunkMan
