

shield orbiting blips

neutral ships

SOUND:
  environment!
  burning
  force field work
  star journey:
   start
   finish
   working
  no ammo
  projectile work
  item pick up
  ability:
    activation
    rejection
    out of charges

ASK:
  landscape types?


PARTICLES:
  asteroid split
  star journey
  star ports
  abilities

TRIVIAL:
  there should be only one asteroid belt per system, near the center
  mainStation should be in the center of the system
  better sky colors?
  force beacon textures
  black filler inside planets, also lower planet tiles should have darker tint


+++++++++++FROM THIS POINT, NO NEW CONTENT IS ADDED TO THE GAME


BUGS:
  starports should be on differernt distances from planet center, since now they overlap
  isPlaceEmpty should consider mazes and special encounters? or should it consider every daym thing?
  planet tiles and stations movement method creates glitches
  bullets fly thru ships sometimes -- blame shields... needs better understanding of Box2D categories
  bullets are too narrow on phone -- use realLineWidth() as a minimum width
  strange shard speeds
  multiple enemies spawn in one point on planet --   remember consumed angles on planet
  ships somehow get inside planet -- blame the current movement method?
  farBg appears to late...

FEATURES:
  brakes?
  dynamic AI shoot angle
  Guardian DestProvider should be able to guard not only a ship, but also Vector2 targetPos
  ground ships should use Guardian DestProvider
  loot should be pulled more gently: just apply force
  smooth camera rotation + sometimes camera does 360 when leaving a planet
  get rid of generated white texture -- use the one of texMan
  enemies sholuld use abilities
  getNearestEnemy should consider enemy size... And many other places should negate ship sizes from dst...
  drop items + sound

PERF:
  build everything as far
  use circles instead of polys
  get rid of getVec, use static vectors, 3 should be enough
  far ship positions should be calculated on demand?


TRADING:
  jsons will have tradeItems, that would resolve in the list of items
  ships will start with half of that items
  ships will slowly generate new items from that list
  ships will not generate if they already possess item (or 5 if clips)
  ships to buy:
    jsons will have tradeShips
    the rest is the same as for items
  ships to hire


FEATURES:
  hardness


UI:
  new UI
  "new" mark in the inventory


===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use starChunkMan?

ARCHITECTURE
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0. But this would require reusing solTex used by emitters

FEATURES
  moar abilities
  damaged ship hulls in place of exploded ships
  random encounters
  planet labyrinths?
  respawn enemies?
  explorers should avoid tough enemies
  ship traces reusable?
  save
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  try using shaders

PERF
  use objFloatMap in soundMan
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  make ChunkMan distances constants
  less or equal in ChunkMan

DISPOSE
  BitmapFont
  ParticleEffect
