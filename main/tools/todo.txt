

Special Effects, receives size, uses no ECs:
  ship explosion
  asteroid split
  star journey
  star ports

projectiles.json:
  trailEffect
  bodyEffect
  collisionEffects
  projectiles should build explosion objects themselves




ITEMS:
  projectiles.json:
    isGuided
    particlesPerShot
  shotgun
  bombs

  shield orbiting blips

  ship unique abilities:
    EM field:
      disable ship controls
      duration
      particle
    Blabla field:
      reduce shield power
      amount
    Force field:
      knock everything back
      amount
    teleporter:
      teleports you around enemy, but not near planets or stations (otherwise bugs possible)
      max angle: from 15 to 180
    ??


ASK:
  landscape types?


TRADING:
  jsons will have tradeItems, that would resolve in the list of items
  ships will start with half of that items
  ships will slowly generate new items from that list
  ships will not generate if they already possess item (or 5 if clips)
  trading ships:
    jsons will have tradeShips
    the rest is the same as for items


TRIVIAL:
  better sky colors
  add colors.json where an artist could define:
    dust color
    in-game sun color
    ???
  force beacon textures
  black filler inside planets, also lower planet tiles should have darker tint
  force field work sound
  star journey in and out, working
  burning sound
  move engine effects to hull?

+++++++++++FROM THIS POINT, NO NEW CONTENT IS ADDED TO THE GAME


FEATURES:
  brakes?
  dynamic AI shoot angle
  Guardian DestProvider should be able to guard not only a ship, but also Vector2 targetPos
  ground ships should use Guardian DestProvider
  loot should be pulled more gently: just apply force
  smooth camera rotation + sometimes camera does 360 when leaving a planet
  get rid of generated white texture -- use the one of texMan


TRIVIAL:
  starports should be on differernt distances from planet center, since now they overlap
  there should be only one asteroid belt per system, near the center
  mainStation should be in the center of the system


BUGS:
  isPlaceEmpty should consider mazes and special encounters? or should it consider every daym thing?
  planet tiles and stations movement method creates glitches
  bullets fly thru ships sometimes -- blame shields... needs better understanding of Box2D categories
  bullets are too narrow on phone -- use realLineWidth() as a minimum width
  strange shard speeds
  multiple enemies spawn in one point on planet --   remember consumed angles on planet
  ships somehow get inside planet -- blame the current movement method?


PERF:
  build everything as far
  use circles instead of polys
  get rid of getVec, use static vectors, 3 should be enough
  far ship positions should be calculated on demand?

FEATURES:
  hardness


UI:
  new UI
  "new" mark in the inventory


===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use starChunkMan?

BUGS

ARCHITECTURE
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0. But this would require reusing solTex used by emitters

FEATURES
  damaged ship hulls in place of exploded ships
  random encounters
  planet labyrinths?
  respawn enemies?
  explorers should avoid tough enemies
  ship traces reusable?
  save
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  try using shaders

PERF
  use objFloatMap in soundMan
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  make ChunkMan distances constants
  less or equal in ChunkMan
