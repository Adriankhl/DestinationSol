
ui icon placeholders
auto fill ships with ammo & ability charges
enemies should use abilities
systemConfig:
  temporaryInnerEnemies
  isHard: true
planetConfig:
  isHard: true
hull sizes, g e positions


UI:
  dangerous system regions (3 radii) & planets (2 radii)
    create method to check the theoretical difficulty of enemies


DRAWING:
  guns
  projectiles
  electricity particle
  ui icons
  trees on frozen
  ability effects + teleport blip
  new title


MISC:
  smarter missile guide
  better far ship update -- looks like it's not accurate now, guardians fly too fast
  ammo count in inv -- implement map, isSame should return false on all stateful objects, check isSame usages
  longer planet turret shoot dist -- should be just like anybody's else
  unfixed mounts should point forward when no enemy
  far ship positions should be calculated on demand?
  ship rotation shouldn't affect repair
  ship rotates on map when controlled by mouse
  ships get stuck in ground -- perhaps due to different conversion radii
  make title bigger
  bg in title screen
  item pick up sound
  item color categories
  improve physics paths


TEST ANDROID RUN:
  pack textures, launch on android to ensure that everything works


PERF:
  texture packing optimizations:
    split big stations from ships
    divide particles folder to misc & ship abilities
    unite asteroids, farJunks, junks and shards in 1 folder
    move skies to misc
  map and ui should carefully draw. implement some class that helps to store values
  cache frequently used values:
    body masses
    cam.realLineWidth?
    some other calculated stuff
    object's distance to np, to cam?
  skip emitter ops if they're not working
  use circles instead of polys where possible


ANDROID RUN 2:
  stress test on every object preloaded


PERF OPTIONAL:
  split item icons from ui icons from ship icons
  optimize getVec? but don't remove, cuz freeing helps fix bugs
  compare dstSq instead of dst -- maybe not needed, iterating through object is only quadratic


FINAL BALANCING


IN THE END:
  tutorial should consider new control type, also mobile, also highlight buttons
  demo
  check licenses:
    in-game:
      font
      sounds
      libgdx
      box 2d
      java distro
    in internet:
      sf
      markets vs open source

===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use another chunk layer for stars

ARCHITECTURE
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0. But this would require reusing solTex used by emitters
  sound volumes should be kept in one map file?

FEATURES
  "dangerous enemy near" warning
  brakes
  inventory category filtering
  boss-like stations on planets and space
  decorative houses on planets
  out of ability charges sound
  out of ammo sound
  environment sounds
  shield orbiting blips: use some static pulsating texture that will fade away with shield life?
  dmg effects should reflect dmg amt
  varying maze tile sizes
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better sky colors?
  starports should be on differernt distances from planet center, since now they overlap
  voice warnings
  ship traces reusable?
  update pitch to all played sounds if game time is changed?
  damaged ship hulls in place of exploded ships
  random encounters
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  planet labyrinths?
  save?
  respawn enemies
  explorers should avoid tough enemies
  try using shaders

PERF
  use objFloatMap in soundMan
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  improve teleport -- transfer body instantly via setTransform()
  get rid of Pilot.getMapHint
