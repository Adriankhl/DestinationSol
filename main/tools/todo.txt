
split item icons from ui icons??

guardians should ignore enemies if they're far from targets
enemies should use abilities
reincarnate with part of items
control types
brakes
ability recharge ui
planet name announcement on approach
fading compass on planet
"new" mark in the inventory
calculate weapon dangerousness: consider emCharge, knockback, guidedness, number of projectiles


UI SOUND:
  blip when warning
  "dangerous enemy near" warning
  voice assistant?


CONTENT:
  systemConfig:
    temporaryInnerEnemies
    isHard: true
  planetConfig:
    isHard: true
  belt: isHard

  item pick up sound
  item color categories

new ui style

DEPENDS ON GAME LENGTH:
  save
  respawn enemies
  explorers should avoid tough enemies


PERF:
  pack textures, launch on android to ensure that everything works
  stress test on every object preloaded
  map and ui should carefully draw. implement some class that helps to store values
  texture packing is needed
  build everything as far + SG.isPlaceEmpty should iterate over far objs
  optimize getVec? but don't remove, cuz freeing helps fix bugs
  far ship positions should be calculated on demand?
  cache body masses
  cache other frequently used values: cam.realLineWidth?
  compare dstSq instead of dst
  use circles instead of polys where possible
  split images into more folders:
    ship abilities from regular effects
    often used vs rarely used
  skip emitter ops if they're not working
  if something can be recalculated rarely, do so

===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use another chunk layer for stars

ARCHITECTURE
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0. But this would require reusing solTex used by emitters
  sound volumes should be kept in one map file?

FEATURES
  inventory category filtering
  boss-like stations on planets and space
  decorative houses on planets
  out of ability charges sound
  out of ammo sound
  environment sounds
  shield orbiting blips: use some static pulsating texture that will fade away with shield life?
  dmg effects should reflect dmg amt
  varying maze tile sizes
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better sky colors?
  starports should be on differernt distances from planet center, since now they overlap
  ship traces reusable?
  update pitch to all played sounds if game time is changed?
  damaged ship hulls in place of exploded ships
  random encounters
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  planet labyrinths?
  try using shaders

PERF
  use objFloatMap in soundMan
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  improve teleport -- transfer body instantly via setTransform()
  get rid of Pilot.getMapHint
