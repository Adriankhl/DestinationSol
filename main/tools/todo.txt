
SG.isPlaceEmpty should iterate over far objs

mouse control vs repair
check sun radius in map
ships spawn in sun
fix planet station origins
mouse control + map = rotation
ships get stuck in ground -- perhaps due to different conversion radii
bg in title screen

CONTENT:
  systemConfig:
    temporaryInnerEnemies
    isHard: true
  planetConfig:
    isHard: true
  belt: isHard
  new title
  item pick up sound
  item color categories


DEPENDS ON GAME LENGTH:
  ability ammo?
    enemies should use abilities?
  save
  respawn enemies
  explorers should avoid tough enemies


PERF:
  pack textures, launch on android to ensure that everything works
  stress test on every object preloaded
  split item icons from ui icons from ship icons
  map and ui should carefully draw. implement some class that helps to store values
  texture packing is needed
  optimize getVec? but don't remove, cuz freeing helps fix bugs
  far ship positions should be calculated on demand?
  cache body masses
  cache other frequently used values: cam.realLineWidth?
  compare dstSq instead of dst
  use circles instead of polys where possible
  split images into more folders:
    ship abilities from regular effects
    often used vs rarely used
  skip emitter ops if they're not working
  if something can be recalculated rarely, do so


IN THE END:
  tutorial should consider new control type, also mobile, also highlight buttons
  make title bigger
  demo
  check licenses:
    in-game:
      font
      sounds
      libgdx
      box 2d
      java distro
    in internet:
      sf
      markets vs open source

===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use another chunk layer for stars

ARCHITECTURE
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0. But this would require reusing solTex used by emitters
  sound volumes should be kept in one map file?

FEATURES
  "dangerous enemy near" warning
  brakes
  inventory category filtering
  boss-like stations on planets and space
  decorative houses on planets
  out of ability charges sound
  out of ammo sound
  environment sounds
  shield orbiting blips: use some static pulsating texture that will fade away with shield life?
  dmg effects should reflect dmg amt
  varying maze tile sizes
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better sky colors?
  starports should be on differernt distances from planet center, since now they overlap
  voice warnings
  ship traces reusable?
  update pitch to all played sounds if game time is changed?
  damaged ship hulls in place of exploded ships
  random encounters
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  planet labyrinths?
  try using shaders

PERF
  use objFloatMap in soundMan
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  improve teleport -- transfer body instantly via setTransform()
  get rid of Pilot.getMapHint
