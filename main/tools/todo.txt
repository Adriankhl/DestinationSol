CONTENT:
  GUNS & projectiles!
    em bombs on Frozen
  ARMOR
  SHIELDS
  ability ammo?
  systemConfig:
    temporaryInnerEnemies
    isHard: true
  planetConfig:
    isHard: true
  belt: isHard


DRAWING:
  electricity particle
  ui icons
  trees on frozen
  ability effects
  new title


MISC:
  far ship positions should be calculated on demand?
  mouse control vs repair
  fix planet station origins
  mouse control + map = rotation
  ships get stuck in ground -- perhaps due to different conversion radii
  make title bigger
  bg in title screen
  enemies should use abilities
  item pick up sound
  item color categories


BALANCING


TEST ANDROID RUN:
  pack textures, launch on android to ensure that everything works


PERF:
  remove unnecessary files
  resize some textures down
  map and ui should carefully draw. implement some class that helps to store values
  cache frequently used values:
    body masses
    cam.realLineWidth?
    some other calculated stuff
  split images into more folders:
    ship abilities from regular effects
    often used vs rarely used
  skip emitter ops if they're not working
  use circles instead of polys where possible


ANDROID RUN 2:
  stress test on every object preloaded


PERF OPTIONAL:
  split item icons from ui icons from ship icons
  optimize getVec? but don't remove, cuz freeing helps fix bugs
  compare dstSq instead of dst -- maybe not needed, iterating through object is only quadratic


IN THE END:
  tutorial should consider new control type, also mobile, also highlight buttons
  demo
  check licenses:
    in-game:
      font
      sounds
      libgdx
      box 2d
      java distro
    in internet:
      sf
      markets vs open source

===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use another chunk layer for stars

ARCHITECTURE
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0. But this would require reusing solTex used by emitters
  sound volumes should be kept in one map file?

FEATURES
  "dangerous enemy near" warning
  brakes
  inventory category filtering
  boss-like stations on planets and space
  decorative houses on planets
  out of ability charges sound
  out of ammo sound
  environment sounds
  shield orbiting blips: use some static pulsating texture that will fade away with shield life?
  dmg effects should reflect dmg amt
  varying maze tile sizes
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better sky colors?
  starports should be on differernt distances from planet center, since now they overlap
  voice warnings
  ship traces reusable?
  update pitch to all played sounds if game time is changed?
  damaged ship hulls in place of exploded ships
  random encounters
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  planet labyrinths?
  save?
  respawn enemies
  explorers should avoid tough enemies
  try using shaders

PERF
  use objFloatMap in soundMan
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  improve teleport -- transfer body instantly via setTransform()
  get rid of Pilot.getMapHint
