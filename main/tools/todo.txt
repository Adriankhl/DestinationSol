
planet tiles and stations movement method creates glitches -- maybe angles are not precise?
bullets fly thru ships sometimes -- blame shields... needs better understanding of Box2D categories
strange shard speeds
multiple enemies spawn in one point on planet --   remember consumed angles on planet
Guardian DestProvider should be able to guard not only a ship, but also Vector2 targetPos
smooth camera rotation + sometimes camera does 360 when leaving a planet
ground ships should use Guardian DestProvider
brakes?
enemies should use abilities
drop items
getNearestEnemy should consider enemy size... And many other places should negate ship sizes from dst...
farBg appears too late...
starports should be on differernt distances from planet center, since now they overlap
ships somehow get inside planet -- blame the current movement method?


PERF:
  build everything as far
  use circles instead of polys
  get rid of getVec, use static vectors, 3 should be enough
  far ship positions should be calculated on demand?
  test on every object preloaded


SOUND:
  environment!
  burning
  force field work
  star journey:
   start
   finish
   working
  no ammo
  projectile work
  items:
    pick up
    drop
  ability:
    activation
    rejection
    out of charges


PARTICLES:
  asteroid split: should use explSmoke effect with some special texture
  star ports: replace static energy lines with some nice effects.. Probably 4 similar from each side & something in the center
  star journey: replace static image with some nice effect
  abilities


DISCUSS:
  landscape types?
  shield orbiting blips: use some static pulsating texture that will fade away with shield life?
  better sky colors?


BORING:
  force beacon: replace static texture with moving ones
  black filler inside planets + lower planet tiles should have darker tint
  bullets are too narrow on phone -- use realLineWidth() as a minimum width
  set pitch to all played sounds if game time is changed


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ AFTER ALL CONTENT IS IN THE GAME


BALANCE:
  neutral ships
  hardness
  move mazes closer?


TRADING:
  jsons will have tradeItems, that would resolve in the list of items
  ships will start with half of that items
  ships will slowly generate new items from that list
  ships will not generate if they already possess item (or 5 if clips)
  ships to buy:
    jsons will have tradeShips
    the rest is the same as for items
  ships to hire


UI:
  new UI
  "new" mark in the inventory


===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use starChunkMan?

ARCHITECTURE
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0. But this would require reusing solTex used by emitters

FEATURES
  moar abilities
  damaged ship hulls in place of exploded ships
  random encounters
  planet labyrinths?
  respawn enemies?
  explorers should avoid tough enemies
  ship traces reusable?
  save
  make buttons size based on real screen size + test on tablets
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  try using shaders

PERF
  use objFloatMap in soundMan
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  improve teleport -- transfer body instantly via setTransform()
  make ChunkMan distances constants
  less or equal in ChunkMan
